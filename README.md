*** Data Structure
The bulk of the translation burden can be handled with a translation hash, a list of key-value pairs that matches RegEx expressions to English language translations. Since translation from RegEx must be 1-to-1, it will have a simpler hash. Translation from English into RegEx can take multiple potential phrasings, so the translation hash will be much more extensive. Fortunately the structure of the hash still provides clear translation for simple expressions.

*** Control Flow
In addition, we will need to build several variables to track state as we iterate through the string to translate an expression. For instance, the meaning of characters changes while inside square brackets. With a state variable, we can set the insideSquareBrackets boolean to true when we pass a valid bracket and set it to false once more when we pass the closing bracket. We can handle deeper nesting by iterating a count variable and then decrementing it as each corresponding closing bracket is reached.
Meanwhile, we can also check that characters are being escaped (with a backslash '\') in a similar fashion. This would also prevent escaped square brackets from being misinterpreted.
